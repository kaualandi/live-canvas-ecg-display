# Live Canvas ECG Display

This Javascript code visualizes live ECG data on HTML Canvas. This is a follow-up project based on my other repository [canvas-ecg-display](https://github.com/smappaa/canvas-ecg-display), in which I had hard-coded different rhythms and artifacts to mimic a real ECG monitor.

I am currently using an example JSON of the data that would otherwise be streamed from a server using a Websocket.
